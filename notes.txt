- reaplce NDN with general "ccn"
	 any ICN-variant that has I/C support is supported by this 
	 something that shares interest/content features with CCN/NDN (named content, caches, etc etc)
 - caching is not really used 
 ***- really only relying on itnerest/content paradigm
 - anonymously share code (low priority)
 - link to code in implementation section
 - how many hops does tor recommend/need?
 - emphasize why this can't be compared with Tor (apples/avacados - transport layer nonexistent, NDN is better arch)
