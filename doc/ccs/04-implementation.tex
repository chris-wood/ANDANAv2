\section{Implementation} \label{sec:introduction}
{\sf AND} is implemented entirely in C using the CCNx 0.82 library \cite{ccnx}. Anonymizing routers run instances of the {\tt AnonServer} application with a single prefix URI, whereas consumers run instances of the {\tt AnonConsumer} application with a set of configuration options and sequence of prefix URIs denoting the circuit to be constructed. The {\tt AnonServer} module instantiates a single {\tt DownstreamProxy}, which is a subclass of the base {\tt Proxy} class used to interface with the CCN daemon running on the host. This downstream proxy is responsible for unwrapping incoming interests and wrapping upstream content. It is also responsible for maintaining the session state information associated with each circuit.
