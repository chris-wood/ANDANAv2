Notes:
- windowing approach needed for interests to account for interest/content loss along the router
- unlinkability is not provided in Tor (but we get unlinkability)
=> 1 hop ANDANA ~ 2 hop TOR
- need to do proof of anonymity for 1 router (if adv compromises producer and node, and can listen on backpath close to node, then security compromised)
- what about trust? how to find PKs of routers? code shipped with hash digest of directory service (or something else besides a directory service?)
- how does a router publish its name prefix to accept anonymizing traffic?
  -> need to address the fact that each router has a globally addressable name

Evaluation:
- have spread out nodes in AWS
- only limit to 1/2 hops in the circuit

Conferences:
- ICN: May 30
- ICNP: May 9
- CCS: May 16
- WPES: end of June deadline

Summer ideas:
- extending network-layer trust model to application layer (SYSTEMS/DESIGN):
	1: how to specify trust model at application?
	2: what should the API for specifying trust model and parameters (e.g., key locations) look like?
	3: what kinds of applications to test with different trust models? (email, ---key name service---, web, bidirectional traffic, etc...)
	4: what kind of trust models should even exist?
- access control/accounting (CRYPTO/SYSTEMS/DESIGN):
	1: reservation and broadcast encryption, CP/KP-ABE
	2: what kind of revocation-friendly access control schemes exist?
	3: can we avoid online requirement for access?...
	4: WTF TO DO WITH REVOCATION?
- (hierarchy) identity-based crypto for human-readable keys
	-> signatures, not encryption, does it exist?...
