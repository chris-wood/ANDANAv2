Notes:
- windowing approach needed for interests to account for interest/content loss along the router
- unlinkability is not provided in Tor (but we get unlinkability)
=> 1 hop ANDANA ~ 2 hop TOR
- need to do proof of anonymity for 1 router (if adv compromises producer and node, and can listen on backpath close to node, then security compromised)
- what about trust? how to find PKs of routers? code shipped with hash digest of directory service (or something else besides a directory service?)
- how does a router publish its name prefix to accept anonymizing traffic?
  -> need to address the fact that each router has a globally addressable name

Evaluation:
- have spread out nodes in AWS
- only limit to 1/2 hops in the circuit
